    "If you imagine walking from $y$ to each of the inputs, you might notice a similarity between the edges you pass through and the equations above. If you walk from $y$ to $x$, you'll pass through `a->c->d`.  Similarly, if you walk from $y$ to $m$, you'll pass through `a->d->e`. Notice that both paths go through `c`, the edge coming out of `add` that corresponds to the input $u_2$ and that both equations also include the term $\\frac{\\partial \\texttt{add}(u_1, u_2)}{\\partial u_2}$.

If we multiply these together, we get exactly $\\frac{\\partial \\texttt{add}(u_1, u_2)}{\\partial u_2}\\frac{\\partial \\texttt{mul}(u_1, u_2)}{\\partial u_1} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}$!\n",

    "\n",
    "> If an edge is not the input to any function, its derivative is 1\n",

Here however, because we know the input to each operation and the formula for the derivative wrt each of its inputs, we can plug in the values to calculate the actual value of each derivative. This means that all that remains is to multiply the right numbers together.\n",

    "### The Algorithm™\n",

    "We have actually already converted our functions into graphs. If you recall earlier, when we generate a tensor from an operation, we recorded the arguments to the operation. This means the we have edges from the output tensor from and operation to the input tensors of the operation. \n",

    "This means that our next challenge is to find all paths from the tensor we want to differentiate to the input tensors that created it. Because none of our operations are self referential (outputs are never fed back in as inputs), and all of our edges have a direction, our graph of operations is a special type of graph called a directed acyclic graph or DAG. This means that we can find all paths to every parameter pretty easily with a Breadth First Search (or Depth First Search but BFS is better for an algorithm we'll run later).\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "From nothing, we have now written an algorithm that will let us differentiate any mathematical expression (provided it only involves addition, subtraction and multiplication). We did this by converting our expression into a graph and reimagining partial derivatives as operations on the edges of that graph. Then we found that could apply Breadth First Search to combine all the derivatives together to get a final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a library that can differentiate simple expressions, the next logical question is whether we can make it any better and the answer is yes we can. In the next post, we'll figure out how to extend our algorithm to vectors and matrices and we'll use that knowledge to build up to a functioning neural network."
