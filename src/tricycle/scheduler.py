"""Provides learning rate scheduling functions and classes.

This module contains implementations of linear and cosine learning rate
schedules with optional warmup periods. These can be used to dynamically
adjust learning rates during training of machine learning models.

Typical usage example:

  schedule = CosineSchedule(max_learning_rate=6e-4, min_learning_rate=0,
                            total_steps=5000, warmup_steps=100)
  learning_rate = schedule(current_step)
